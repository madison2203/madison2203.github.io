    <h1>Interactive Media</h1>
    <p1>
      The first thing I paid attention to was the scribble on the page, at first
      I thought there were just some doodles but turns out it was the sketch of
      the building. Plus, there is a sign that says “click anywhere to enable
      sound” , which makes me curious. After knowing that the website also
      incorporates classical music throughout the article, I see this page is
      very interesting so I went on to discover this website to see its
      function and interactive.
    </p1>

    <p2>
      My discrete action when interact with the site:
      <ul>Click mouse to enable music like the instruction</ul> 
      <ul> Read the description of the website</ul>
      <ul>Scroll down to see the contents</ul> 
      <ul>Scroll all the way down to the end of the website </ul>
      <ul>Scroll up to see one of the contents 
      <ul>Scroll up to the top of the page</ul> 
    </p2>

    <p3>The part I spent most of my time on was reading the information in the page while listening to the music. I was informed by a massive amount of information about the progress of creating a concert hall. Meanwhile, watch the video clips about the interview of Frank Gehry explaining the stages of creating the building. Moreover, I try to read the context title because they were in a font that I could not read well.

    <p4>The most action I did when experiencing the web page was scrolling up and down. At the top page I scrolled down to see the contents and the interactions of the page, curious about whether there will be another interactive action engaged. When I am at the end of the page, I scroll up to the top to see if anything different happens. For example: “Does the music stop after I read all the information?” or “ Does the pages main image change into a different one if I scroll the page from the bottom to the top?”
