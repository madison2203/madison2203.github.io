        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <div class="para1">
        The first thing I paid attention to was the scribble on the page, at
        first I thought there were just some doodles but turns out it was the
        sketch of the building. Plus, there is a sign that says “click anywhere
        to enable sound”, which makes me curious. After knowing that the website
        also incorporates classical music throughout the article, I see this
        page is very interesting so I went on to discover this website to see
        its function and interactive.

      <div class="Q2">
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </div>
      <div class="para2">
          -Click mouse to enable music like the instruction </br>
          -Read the description of the website</br>
          -Scroll down to see the contents </br>
          -Scroll all the way down to the end of the website </br>
          -Scroll up to see one of the contents </br>
          -Scroll up to the top of the page </br>

      <div class="Q3">
        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </div>
      <div class="para3">
        The part I spent most of my time on was reading the information in the
        page while listening to the music. I was informed by a massive amount of
        information about the progress of creating a concert hall. Meanwhile,
        watch the video clips about the interview of Frank Gehry explaining the
        stages of creating the building. Moreover, I try to read the context’s
        title because they were in a font that I could not read well.
      </div>
      <div class="Q4">
        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <div class="para4">
        The most action I did when experiencing the web page was scrolling up
        and down. At the top page I scrolled down to see the contents and the
        interactions of the page, curious about whether will there be another
        interactive action engaged. When I am at the end of the page, I scroll
        up to the top to see if anything different happens. For example: “Does
        the music stop after I read all the information?” or “ Does the page’s
        main image change into a different one if I scroll the page from the
        bottom to the top?”
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q5">
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </div>
      <div class="para5">
        The intended goal of this website is to help users to understand more
        about the progress of Frank Gehry and his team to develop a building,
        which is known as the Walt Disney Concert Hall. This aims to inform
        people to know more about the stages in making the concert hall.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q6">
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </div>
      <div class="para6">
        In this website, it is made for the user to understand more the concept
        of creating the building. It is used to display the progress of the
        building and the cooperation with the orchestra. The page takes users
        from the beginning of the progress but easier interaction, just need to
        scroll down to read the information. Users will not have to open too
        many tabs on their devices to find out about the Walt Disney Concert
        Hall. All the information is well combined into this website to
        introduce the Walt Disney Concert Hall was constructed by architect
        Frank Gehry and his team.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q7">
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </div>
      <div class="para7">
        Since this is a website that has information about a building created by
        Frank Gehry, it is a place where people who are interested in Frank
        Gehry’s building can access, as well as people who like architecture,
        interior and exterior design. Additionally, not just architects might be
        interested in visiting the website, developers or students can also
        access the website as a reference. Or simply people who are located near
        that building want to discover more about what's inside that building
        and are there any features in that construction. In my opinion, this is
        a short term engagement website interaction. But this website made me
        curious about both the interaction and information. I can spend time
        reading and absorbing the documents with the classical music background.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q8">
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </div>
      <div class="para8">
        This page does not have any mechanisms or features that encourages users
        to engage with it repeatedly.The website does not have a log in/ sign up
        or join membership to save users information. All of the information
        work of the concert hall building was being displayed on the website.
        However, I believe the format display of the website will change
        overtime to catch up with new trends. I took an advance looking up an
        online article in 2023 that gave a review about this website and
        recognized that a few years ago, the display format was different from
        the current one. And with this research, I think the developers have
        changed the main picture and added classical music to the site.
      </div>
      <br />
      
      <div class="Q9">
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </div>
      <div class="para9">
        With pure observation, I can see this site display the details on the
        making progress. Moreover, the classical music engaged with the pop up
        video really got me more into the website. The display gave me the
        feeling of I am in the real exhibition of the building. I can read the
        pure information, look at the models, and have manual interactions.
        Furthermore, engaging with video clips reminded me of the Youtube online
        platform. It appears the previous video if I want to keep scrolling down
        to read the information, or actually play the video if I want to watch
        it right away.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q10">
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="para10">
        Throughout the interaction, the website developer team wants to bring
        the exhibition online so that users can be amazed with the amount of
        work and information when constructing the building without going to the
        actual building in LA. The experiment got more enhanced when it included
        interviews, video clips as well as the design models and classical
        music.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q11">
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="para11">
        The decent format display of the web page, the team successfully evokes
        delighted emotion, surprise, excitement and curiosity in people who are
        interested in constructions and music lovers, as well as people who are
        working in the creative field. Taking users to the real exhibition that
        displays everything involved to the concert hall, enhancing relaxation
        and enjoyment when interacting with the site.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q12">
        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </div>
      <div class="para12">
        The most frustrating part when experiencing the web is that the title of
        each section was being displayed in a font that I found difficult to
        read at the first time. Besides, the introduction of the building was
        not displayed thoroughly in one scroll, I had to keep scrolling to read
        the introduction section. If I scroll too rapidly, the content will
        speed up and I could not read the details yet. On the other hand, if I
        leave the interaction unattended, the content will not load at the
        moment.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q13">
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </div>
      <div class="para13">
        Meanwhile, the satisfying part when interacting with the website was
        that I can both listen to the music and read the information. The
        details were in a decent display that are easy to read. Plus, the video
        clips pop up to inform me more about the process of making the building
        really interesting. I do not need to go to other platforms to see the
        processing video clips as well as the interviews.
