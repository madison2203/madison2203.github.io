    <h1>Interactive Media</h1>
    <p1>
      The first thing I paid attention to was the scribble on the page, at first
      I thought there were just some doodles but turns out it was the sketch of
      the building. Plus, there is a sign that says “click anywhere to enable
      sound” , which makes me curious. After knowing that the website also
      incorporates classical music throughout the article, I see this page is
      very interesting so I went on to discover this website to see its function
      and interactive.
    </p1>

    <p2>
      My discrete action when interact with the site: <br />
      -Click mouse to enable music like the instruction -Read the description of
      the website -Scroll down to see the contents -Scroll all the way down to
      the end of the website -Scroll up to see one of the contents -Scroll up to
      the top of the page
    </p2>

      >The part I spent most of my time on was reading the information in the
      page while listening to the music. I was informed by a massive amount of
      information about the progress of creating a concert hall. Meanwhile,
      watch the video clips about the interview of Frank Gehry explaining the
      stages of creating the building. Moreover, I try to read the context’s
      title because they were in a font that I couldn’t read well.
    </p3>

    <p4
      >The most action I did when experiencing the web page was scrolling up and
      down. At the top page I scrolled down to see the contents and the
      interactions of the page, curious about whether there will be another
      interactive action engaged. When I’m at the end of the page, I scroll up
      to the top to see if anything different happens. For example: “Does the
      music stop after I read all the information?” or “ Does the page’s main
      image change into a different one if I scroll the page from the bottom to
      the top?”
    </p4>

    <p5
      >The intended goal of this website is to help users to understand more
      about the progress of Frank Gehry and his team to develop a building,
      which is known as the Walt Disney Concert Hall. This aims to inform people
      to know more about the stages in making the concert hall.
    </p5>

    <p6
      >In this website, it is made for the user to understand more the concept
      of creating the building. It is used to display the progress of the
      building and the cooperation with the orchestra. The page takes users from
      the beginning of the progress but easier interaction, just need to scroll
      down to read the information. Users will not have to open too many tabs on
      their devices to find out about the Walt Disney Concert Hall. All the
      information is well combined into this website to introduce the Walt
      Disney Concert Hall was constructed by architect Frank Gehry and his team.
    </p6>

    <p7
      >Since this is a website that has information about a building created by
      Frank Gehry, it is a place where people who are interested in Frank
      Gehry’s building can access, as well as people who like architecture,
      interior and exterior design. Additionally, not just architects might be
      interested in visiting the website, developers or students can also access
      the website as a reference. Or simply people who are located near that
      building want to discover more about what's inside that building and are
      there any features in that construction. In my opinion, this is a short
      term engagement website interaction. But this website made me curious
      about both the interaction and information. I can spend time reading and
      absorbing the documents with the classical music background.
    </p7>

    <p8
      >This page does not have any mechanisms or features that encourages users
      to engage with it repeatedly.The website does not have a log in/ sign up
      or join membership to save users information. All of the information work
      of the concert hall building was being displayed on the website. However,
      I believe the format display of the website will change overtime to catch
      up with new trends. I took an advance looking up an online article in 2023
      that gave a review about this website and recognized that a few years ago,
      the display format was different from the current one. And with this
      research, I think the developers have changed the main picture and added
      classical music to the site.
    </p8>

    <p9
      >With pure observation, I can see this site display the details on the
      making progress. Moreover, the classical music engaged with the pop up
      video really got me more into the website. The display gave me the feeling
      of I’m in the real exhibition of the building. I can read the pure
      information, look at the models, and have manual interactions.
      Furthermore, engaging with video clips reminded me of the Youtube online
      platform. It appears the previous video if I want to keep scrolling down
      to read the information, or actually play the video if I want to watch it
      right away.
    </p9>

    <p10
      >Throughout the interaction, the website developer team wants to bring the
      exhibition online so that users can be amazed with the amount of work and
      information when constructing the building without going to the actual
      building in LA. The experiment got more enhanced when it included
      interviews, video clips as well as the design models and classical music.
    </p10>

    <p11
      >The decent format display of the web page, the team successfully evokes
      delighted emotion, surprise, excitement and curiosity in people who are
      interested in constructions and music lovers, as well as people who are
      working in the creative field. Taking users to the real exhibition that
      displays everything involved to the concert hall, enhancing relaxation and
      enjoyment when interacting with the site.
    </p11>

    <p12
      >The most frustrating part when experiencing the web is that the title of
      each section was being displayed in a font that I found difficult to read
      at the first time. Besides, the introduction of the building was not
      displayed thoroughly in one scroll, I had to keep scrolling to read the
      introduction section. If I scroll too rapidly, the content will speed up
      and I could not read the details yet. On the other hand, if I leave the
      interaction unattended, the content will not load at the moment.
    </p12>

    <p13
      >Meanwhile, the satisfying part when interacting with the website was that
      I can both listen to the music and read the information. The details were
      in a decent display that are easy to read. Plus, the video clips pop up to
      inform me more about the process of making the building really
      interesting. I do not need to go to other platforms to see the processing
      video clips as well as the interviews.
